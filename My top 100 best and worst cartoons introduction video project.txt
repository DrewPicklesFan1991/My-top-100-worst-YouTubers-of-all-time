Hi everyone! I'm Jackson Overfield and guess what? I decided to create a series of 100 videos that I like to call: "What Cartoons do I hate" and "What cartoons do I love".
I got inspired after the AFI's 100 Years 100 Movies as well as the NFL's Top 100 Players of 2017. In this series, I am going to be talking about my top 100 best and worst cartoons of all time and the reasons why I hate them and I love them. 
I'm not going to be doing this for 100 days because I feel like going through this series in one day. Today is October 19, 2017. And I'm actually doing this in alphabetical order.
Also, If I show the series to mommy, I will be putting together this series from 100 to 1. Plus, This is going to be fun and I hope you enjoy this expierence with me. The series may take me all day to make. I will be quicker because all of the videos will be 2 minutes long.
I know that SpongeBob is number one on the best list so I'm going to be wearing my SpongeBob T Shirt when I show it to mommy. 
The reason why I'm going to do this is because I want to actually show you the reasons why I love AND hate all of these cartoons, animation, anime, graphic novels etc.
If I can actually go through all the cartoons on this list, I'll be so proud of myself and show it to everybody in the Overfield family.
So that's all I want to say to you. So, I'll see you on the very first video in the series!
